#  RoyaleAUV3Host

A Simple yet powerfull iOS app to display a list of the AUv3 plugins on your device.

This project **DOES NOT USE** Storyboards or UIKit. **it's 100% SwiftUI and swift based.**

## About this project

I'm very new to the Apple ecosystem and I struggled to find a way not to use Storyboards or older architectures. All the project related to AUv3 hosting  I found relied on UIKit and StoryBoards, something I think that will eventually disappear. 

And I did not want to put a finger there since I already have a great deal of things to learn just using Swift...

So I wish to thank everybody that shared projects (you rock guys!), and here's my little contribution to the community.


##  Important Thing I learnt the hard way

By default you can use the API to load Auv3 plugins. However you will **only fetch Apple plugins** unless you add the following info in your entitlements :

```    
<key>inter-app-audio</key>
<true/>
```

Don't ask me why. But this tiny detail just drove me crazy.
